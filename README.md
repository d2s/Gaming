## Knowledge enriches and improves your gaming experience

After travelling above a cluster of MULEs in _Death Stranding_ via a Zipline, a viewer in my chat stated, _"You were travelling at ## MPHs."_ I had never thought of calculating my rate of speed. The formula is `Speed = Distance/Time`.

Okay, so kids playing _Tomb Raider_ are exposed to physics without even knowing it!
Later in life they will say, _“I’m never going to use physics IRL.”_ Joke is on them!
