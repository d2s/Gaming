# Gaming & Education: ABOUT

A few weeks back, I ran across a Reddit post titled ‘How to Use Your Education’ ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/fiv1aj/how_to_use_your_education/)) which finally got me off my butt to address a phenomenon I have witnessed repeatedly: 
 > People who excel at math tend to have better gear, more in-game currency; and construct better bases/structures.
 
Also, ArionSilver's formula for [calculating remaining fuel](https://github.com/iMorpheus/Gaming/blob/master/Games/GTSPort/Refuelling.md) in GT Sport further proved my belief.

As I suck at math, my gear stats are always meh, I struggle to garner in-game currency and my bases are mishapen eyesores. All this because of my crappy math skills. UGH, if I had only paid attention in class! IF I HAD ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF MATH!

Other examples: 
- After travelling above a cluster of MULEs in _Death Stranding_ via a Zipline, a viewer in my chat stated, _"You were travelling at ## MPHs."_ I had never thought of calculating my rate of speed. The formula is `Speed = Distance/Time`.
- [Understanding The Numbers In _Fallout 76_ : fo76](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ftdw19/understanding_the_numbers_in_fallout_76/)
- Okay, so kids playing _Tomb Raider_ are exposed to physics without even knowing it!
Later in life they will say, _“I’m never going to use physics IRL.”_ Joke is on them!

NOTE: The above focuses on math but there are other areas. For example, color theory.
