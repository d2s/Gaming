### OVERVIEW
I want to start farming in No Man's Sky. Unfortunately, my numeracy/my math skills are meh. My goal here is to rectify that. Before I can even think of farming, I need to identify available information, variables required for math and stuff that requires formulas(?).


### RESOURCE INFORMATION FOUND IN GAME
- NAME: Frost Crystal
- YIELD/OUTPUT: 81 units
- TIME TO YEILD: 1 hour

### VARIBLES: INPUTS
- TimeToYield: Time required before resource is ready for collection measured in minutes.
- Output: Number of units available for collection after TimeToYield
- NumberOfHydroponicTrays: Number of trays to be used
- DesiredYield: Amount of resource desired/reqired.

### VARIABLES: OUTPUT <--Require Inputs and/or Fixed Variables. Formulas?
- NumberOfChecksPerHour: Number of checks per hour
- CarbonRequired: Units of carbon required to build the required number of Hydroponic Trays
- PureFerriteRequired: Units of Pure Ferrite required to build required the number of Hydroponic Trays
- FerriteDustRequired: Units of Ferrite Dust required to build required the number of Metal Plates
- MetalPlatesRequired: Number of Metal Plates required to build the required number of Hydroponic Trays.

### VARIABLES: FIXED
- MinutesInOneHour: Number of minutes in an hour
- HydroponicTrayCost: Resources required to craft one Hydroponic Tray
	- Carbon: 20
	- PureFerrite: 30
	- MetalPlating*2
		* FerriteDust: 50*2

### GOAL: 10 Circuit Boards every 16 Hours
1. Circuit Board Requirements
- 1 Heat Capacitor: 100 Frost Crystals + 200 Solanium
- 1 Poly Fibre: 100 Cactus Flesh + 200 Star Bulb
2. Frost Crystal: 
- 81 units per hour
3. Solanum:
- 81 Units per 16 hours
4. Star Bulb:
- 41 every four hours
5. Cactus Flesh: 
- 162 every sixteen hours
